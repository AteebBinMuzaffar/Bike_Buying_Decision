In this project the various factors affecting the descion of a bike buyer were explored.

The dataset was first cleaned.
Data Cleaning Process: 
1. Remove Duplicates From ID Column
2. Find and Replace Letters in Marital Status and Gender Columns with words to avoid confusion 
3. Create an Age Range Column to Group the Data 
4. Replace Commute Distance "10+ Miles" to "More Than 10 Miles" for proper sorting in pivot tables 

Pivot Tables were made to answer a few questions:
1. Did income affect the buying decision?
2. Did commute distance affect the buying decision?
3. Did buying decision vary with age range?

A dashboard was made based on results of those pivot tables.

The dashboard was made interactable and pivot table results were interlinked
using slicing to check the effect of a factor on various charts, simultaneously.
